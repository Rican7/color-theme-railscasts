# RailsCasts Color Theme/Scheme

A 256-color text-terminal-first "dark UI" syntax highlighting color theme/scheme ("tmTheme") based on the OG [RailsCasts](http://railscasts.com/). Designed for syntect/Sublime Text/TextMate compatible syntax definitions.

Forked from [tdm00/sublime-theme-railscasts](https://github.com/tdm00/sublime-theme-railscasts), which was originally based on [Ryan Bates](http://railscasts.com/about) ([@rbates](https://twitter.com/rbates)) [RailsCasts TextMate theme](http://media.railscasts.com/resources/textmate_theme.zip).
